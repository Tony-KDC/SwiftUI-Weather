#Description:

Hello my name is Anthony this project was fun to make it has a custom background color that I needed to blend to match somthing that apple themselves has on there app. There is a ContentView file that has the main code in it and a file for the weather button that changes the time to night vise versa. I had to learn a new language to build this app but Im willing to keep learing SwiftUI. The icons for he weather were taken from apples SF Symbols application that you can download from the developer site for apple. The hardest part was probably the spacing of everything on the page so that all the icons and text looked good.
